# Machine Vision based Real Time Trajectory Generation (MVbR2TG) üñ•  üëÅ

*Most of the robotic arms used in industrial environments operate in a pre-programmed
cycle. When it comes to the way a human does the same task is much different as
the path planning for picking an object may change from cycle to cycle because of the
perception obtained through human vision.*


*Machine vision is the technology and methods incorporated to mimic the human vision
in order to gain the insights about the operating environment of the robotics system.
However, when it comes to the real time object detection using machine vision, there
is an inevitable trade-off between the accuracy and the speed of the operation. This
depends entirely on the used machine vision algorithms and the computational power of
the available hardware.*
